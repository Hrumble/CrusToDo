# Crustodo
*I asked chatgpt:
"My github is empty, I'd like to get started doing some projects, give me a few ideas"
And one of the first answer was "Make a todo list", so here we are.*

Crustodo is a CLI todo list manager written in rust, i'd like to put "blazingly fast" like every other Rust project out there, but unfortunately, I have no clue if it is.
This is my first Rust project, and I spent all night on it, glad it worked out.
